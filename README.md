# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Todo: 

* USDC token option 
* Crosschain migrate deposits
* LGE 
* Makes LP and locks IT 
* Makes LP and sends it to owner 

* Before Launch, with countdown to launch time
* Launched you can contribute (live for 1-2 days)

* Refund loop
* Whitelisted  & non-whitelisted
* Max per address (need to know what abi endpoint for this one I see it for whitelisted max but not in general)
